## üîπ Abstract
With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, particularly **large language models (LLMs)**, there is an opportunity to transform traditional learning into more personalized, interactive, and effective experiences.  

This study compares three methods of student learning:
1. üìñ **Book-based learning**  
2. ‚å®Ô∏è **LLM-powered interactive chat**  
3. üó£Ô∏è **LLM-powered virtual agent with voice chat**  

A controlled experiment with 27 students measured comprehension, engagement, and satisfaction.  
Results showed that the **typing-chat LLM group achieved the highest knowledge retention**, outperforming both the book-based and avatar groups.

## üîπ Contributions
- Comparative evaluation of AI avatars, chatbots, and traditional methods in education.  
- Empirical evidence of LLM-powered learning effectiveness.  
- Guidelines for educators on designing AI-enhanced learning environments.
